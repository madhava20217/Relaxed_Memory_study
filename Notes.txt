1) KLSM - K Priority Queue: Only benchmarks throughput. There is an R Script to plot thruoghput vs threads, but that is it.
Will need to modify the library to write more data to the results.csv file. 

-- Can only get throughput for a certain number of threads.
-- Results are stored in a csv file containing the benchmark name, number of threads and the throughput.
-- No parameters can be set except number of threads. Will need to look deeper into the script files for determining what to tweak.

2) SprayList: very similar to synchrobench (same flags, arguments, help menu).

Metrics: size, duration, (seed value), added, removed, cleaned, collisions, found, aborts, retries, read transactions, update transactions, , removed , added, locks aborts...

Thing to note: default implementation uses Fraser's Skip-List, but can set a flag to use spraylist. However, it gives a segfault on my machine (need to examine in more detail).
